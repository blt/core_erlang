# Language.Erlang.Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blt/core_erlang.png)](https://travis-ci.org/blt/core_erlang)

This is a _very_ rough start at providing a parser for both [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) and
[Core Erlang](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/cerl/). It doesn't do much
but parse a few elements of the syntax, but there is a quick-check suite in
place and maybe they'll pass?

## Ambitions

Provide a full parser suite for both Erlang and Core Erlang in the style of
[Language.C](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-c). Progress has been
slow because I haven't much time, but I tinker around here and there. :)
